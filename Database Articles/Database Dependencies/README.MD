# SQL Server Database Dependencies

The following documentation is designed to help developers understand the `sys.sql_expression_dependencies` table in Microsoft SQL Server. This repository includes an example walk through of various dependencies, how they interact with the `sys.sql_expression_dependencies` table, and the corresponding scripts essential for grasping this table's functionality and data representation. These scripts also serve as a comprehensive repository of dependencies, including some you may have yet to encounter or consider.

For this documentation, I chose to use GitBook, which you can access with the following link.
